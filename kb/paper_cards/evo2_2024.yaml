summary: |
  StripedHyena 2 foundation model for DNA sequences up to 1 Mbp context.
  Character-level tokenization (512 vocab). Supports autoregressive scoring,
  generation, and RC-aware inference. 1B/7B/40B parameter checkpoints.

key_contributions:
  - "1M+ context window for genomic sequences (StripedHyena 2 architecture)"
  - "Single-nucleotide tokenization with 512-symbol vocab"
  - "RC-aware scoring utilities built-in"
  - "Multi-scale checkpoints (1B/7B/40B) for different compute budgets"

architecture:
  backbone: "StripedHyena 2 (Hyena + Mamba hybrid layers)"
  context_length: "1,048,576 tokens (~1 Mbp)"
  tokenization: "CharLevelTokenizer (A/C/G/T/N + special tokens)"
  params: "1B / 7B / 40B checkpoints"

key_takeaways_for_us:
  - "Ultra-long context useful for regulatory regions, structural variants"
  - "RC-averaging via built-in score_sequences_rc function"
  - "Mean pooling over token embeddings for sequence-level features"
  - "Memory-efficient inference with cached generation"

implications_for_project:
  - "Top candidate for long-context gene embeddings"
  - "Use 7B checkpoint (balance performance/memory)"
  - "Extract exon embeddings → pool to gene → aggregate to subject"
  - "Compare vs Caduceus (RC-equivariant) and GENERator (6-mer)"
