summary: |
  DNABERT-2 is a 117M-parameter BERT encoder for DNA sequences that replaces fixed k-mer tokenization with Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE), enabling flexible vocabulary that adapts to sequence statistics. Pretrained on multi-species genomic data with ALiBi positional bias, it achieves strong zero-shot transfer to understudied organisms and excels at cross-species tasks. The model is paired with the Genome Understanding Evaluation (GUE) benchmark covering diverse genomic prediction tasks.

key_contributions:
  - "BPE tokenization for genomics: learns biologically meaningful subword units (motifs, repeats) instead of fixed k-mers"
  - "Multi-species pretraining: human + model organisms → strong cross-species transfer"
  - "ALiBi positional encoding: enables extrapolation to longer sequences than seen during training"
  - "GUE benchmark: standardized evaluation suite for genomic foundation models across multiple tasks"

implications_for_project:
  - "Alternative to Caduceus for genetics embeddings when RC-equivariance is not critical"
  - "Useful for cross-species validation: test gene-brain associations on mouse/primate orthologs"
  - "BPE tokenization may capture regulatory motifs better than fixed k-mers"
  - "Requires manual RC-averaging (not RC-equivariant like Caduceus)"
  - "Strong baseline for comparison: DNABERT-2 vs. Caduceus RC-equivariance impact"

notes: "DNABERT-2's BPE tokenization offers flexibility for motif discovery, but requires manual RC-averaging. Compare with Caduceus for RC-equivariance vs. tokenization flexibility trade-offs."
