summary: |
  Conference paper (SpringerLink) describing a hybrid Mamba-Transformer for fMRI.
  Combines Mamba's efficient long-range modeling with Transformer's attention for
  spatiotemporal dynamics, demonstrating multitask regression/classification performance
  on UKB and HCP cohorts.

key_contributions:
  - "Hybrid architecture: Mamba for temporal efficiency + Transformer spatial attention"
  - "Multitask pretraining: age/sex/cognitive tasks jointly"
  - "Efficient long-sequence modeling for fMRI time series"

architecture:
  backbone: "Interleaved Mamba + Transformer blocks"
  inputs: "fMRI time series (parcellated or voxel-level)"
  training: "Multitask heads for diverse downstream objectives"

key_takeaways_for_us:
  - "Efficient for long fMRI sequences"
  - "Multitask setup may provide richer embeddings"
  - "Complexity higher than BrainLM/JEPA; test if baselines need boost"

implications_for_project:
  - "Candidate for later exploration if single-task models insufficient"
  - "Defer until after Nov 26 baselines (note: conference paper now officially online)"
  - "Multitask approach could inspire auxiliary objectives"
