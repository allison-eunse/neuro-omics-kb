# Paper Cards

This directory contains YAML files documenting academic papers and publications relevant to the neurogenomics knowledge base.

## Structure

Each paper card (`*.yaml`) documents:
- Publication details and citation information
- Abstract, summary, and key contributions
- Methodology, data, and models used
- Results and key findings
- Code availability and reproducibility
- Related work and integration with KB components
- Impact and annotations

## Template

See `template.yaml` for the paper card schema.

## Usage

1. Copy `template.yaml` to create a new paper card
2. Fill in all relevant fields
3. Use descriptive filenames (e.g., `author-year-title.yaml`, `doi-10.1234-paper.yaml`)

## Naming Convention

Suggested naming conventions:
- `first-author-year-title.yaml` (e.g., `smith-2023-neurogenomics.yaml`)
- `doi-based.yaml` (e.g., `10-1234-5678.yaml`)
- `arxiv-based.yaml` (e.g., `arxiv-2301-12345.yaml`)
