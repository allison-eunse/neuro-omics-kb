name: "Cha Hospital Longitudinal Neurodevelopmental Cohort"
description: |
  Longitudinal multimodal pediatric neurodevelopmental cohort collected at Cha Hospital (exact site(s) TBD).
  Designed for early prediction and characterization of neurodevelopmental disorders (e.g., ASD, ADHD, developmental delay)
  and trajectories of cognitive / behavioural development, aligned with ARPA-H–style Brain-Omics Model (BOM) documentation.
  All numeric values and institutional codes are placeholders and should be updated once DRB/IRB-approved summaries are available.
