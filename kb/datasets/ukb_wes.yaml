name: "UK Biobank Whole-Exome Sequencing (WES) cohort"
description: |
  UK Biobank WES-derived variant and gene-level features used in gene-embedding and polygenic analyses.
  This card describes the cohort and feature table layout for downstream genetics FMs (e.g., Caduceus, Evo2,
  DNABERT-2) and subject-level gene embeddings (e.g., genetics_gene_fm_pca512_v1, genetics_joo_mdd_cog_v1).
