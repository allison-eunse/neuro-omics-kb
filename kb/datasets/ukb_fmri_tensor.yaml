  notes: >
    See docs/data/ukb_data_map.md and docs/integration/modality_features/fmri.md for exact preprocessing steps,
    including spatial normalization, smoothing (if any), and confound regression.
parcellation:
  usage_notes: >
    Tensors are stored in voxel space; parcellation (e.g., Schaefer-400) is applied downstream when deriving ROI
    features (Brain-JEPA tokens, functional connectivity matrices, etc.).
