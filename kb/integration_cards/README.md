# Integration Cards

This directory contains YAML files documenting integrations between models, datasets, tools, and pipelines in the neurogenomics knowledge base.

## Structure

Each integration card (`*.yaml`) documents:
- Components being integrated (models, datasets, tools)
- Integration workflow and purpose
- Requirements and usage
- Documentation and references

## Template

See `template.yaml` for the integration card schema.

## Usage

1. Copy `template.yaml` to create a new integration card
2. Fill in all relevant fields
3. Use descriptive filenames (e.g., `genetics-brain-pipeline.yaml`)
