name: "LLM semantic bridge (multimodal hub)"
modality: multimodal
domain: language
summary: |
  Documentation-only card describing an ARPA-H–style large language model (LLM) used as a common semantic hub
  for brain, EEG/EPhys, and multi-omics foundation model embeddings. The LLM receives subject-level embeddings
  from Brain FMs, EPhys/EEG FMs, and Multi-Omics FMs via adapters or cross-attention, and produces textual
  explanations, reasoning chains, and structured reports.
arch:
  type: "Decoder-only LLM + cross-modal adapters"
  backbone: "TBD (e.g., LLaMA-family or GPT-style backbone used in ARPA-H Brain-Omics Model, BOM)"
  parameters: "TBD (e.g., 7B–155B)"
  context_length: 8192
  special_features:
    - "Cross-attention or FiLM-style adapters that consume brain / EEG / omics embeddings"
    - "CLIP-style contrastive heads for embedding↔text alignment"
    - "Instruction-tuned decoder for medical/developmental explanations and structured reporting"

      preprocessing:

        Subject-level EEG embeddings from cha_dev_eeg_fm_v1 or similar segment→run→subject hierarchies.

notes: |
  This is a documentation-only, forward-looking card for an LLM used as a common semantic hub (ARPA-H BOM concept).
  It records alignment strategies and intended uses so that future implementations remain traceable to the KB.
