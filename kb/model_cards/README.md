# Model Cards

This directory contains YAML files documenting models used in the neurogenomics knowledge base.

## Structure

Each model card (`*.yaml`) documents:
- Model architecture and details
- Training data and procedure
- Evaluation metrics and performance
- Limitations and intended use
- Usage instructions and examples
- Citation and maintenance information

## Template

See `template.yaml` for the model card schema.

## Usage

1. Copy `template.yaml` to create a new model card
2. Fill in all relevant fields
3. Use descriptive filenames (e.g., `genetics-predictor-v1.yaml`, `brain-imaging-classifier.yaml`)
