modality: tabular
domain: multimodal_tabular
summary: >-
  Tabular foundation model released by H. Kossen et al. (Nature 2024). Uses a Transformer
  trained on 100M synthetic SCM-based datasets to emulate Bayesian inference for small/medium
  tabular problems in a single forward pass.
arch:
  type: decoder-only Transformer
  backbone: https://github.com/PriorLabs/TabPFN
  parameters: 11M
  context_length: 10000  # max samples supported per forward pass
  special_features:
    - "Learns from synthetic structural causal models spanning regression/classification tasks"
    - "Predicts labels for entire dataset at inference time (in-context learning)"
    - "Handles up to 500 features with categorical + continuous support"

  notes: "Continuous features normalized; categorical features embedded with learned dictionaries."

tabular_usage:
  training_assumptions:
    max_samples: 10000
    max_features: 500
    missing_values: "Supported via mask tokens"
  inference_recipe:
    - "Format dataset as (x, y) tables with meta mask for unlabeled rows."
    - "Use TabPFN forward pass to get predictive mean/probabilities for unlabeled rows."
    - "No gradient updates; optionally ensemble multiple priors."
intended_use_in_project:
  - "Baseline predictor on raw sMRI ROI tables (smri_free_surfer_raw_176)"
  - "Baseline predictor on genetics summary features (PGS, PCA)"
  - "Fusion predictor on concatenated gene + brain embeddings (fusion_concat_gene_brain_1024_v1)"
limitations:
  - "Published benchmarks cover ≤10k samples; scaling to full UKB (~40k) requires chunking."
  - "Not an fMRI encoder; operates strictly on tabular inputs."
  - "GPU recommended for fast inference; CPU acceptable but slower."

notes: >-
  Treat TabPFN as a downstream predictor that competes with LR/GBDT on embeddings and ROI tables.
  Keep per-fold sample counts ≤10k or stream batches to respect the published limits.
